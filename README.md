# Type3260
This repository includes a TRNSYS model of an horizontal PCM storage tank named Type3260. It was developped by Katherine D'Avignon (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0146-9981) and Michaël Kummert (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1606-8344). Version 1.0.0 was released December, 12th, 2016 and is based on TRNSYS v16. Description of the model can be found in the following publications :

Type 3260 PCM storage tank model

We distribute the Type3260 "PCM storage tank model" including the source code (open source).
Feel free to use the model and adapt or extend it to fulfill your needs.

We would however request that you please:

•	Quote us in any publications when you use our type for your simulations. Please cite the following publication when refering to this model :
Katherine D'Avignon & Michaël Kummert (2018) Modeling horizontal storage tanks with encapsulated phase change materials for building performance simulation, Science and Technology for the Built Environment, 24:4, 327-342, DOI: 10.1080/23744731.2018.1438012
•	Keep us informed of modifications you've made to the source code and your experience with the type
•	We can only give little support because our projects concerning PCM are finished. No further work is planed using this type.
•	The model has only been validated for some special conditions, see chapter 6 of Dre. D'Avignon's thesis, in the documentation section. 
	We decline any responsibility for any results you get by using the type in your simulations outside these specific parameters.
  
Good luck with your simulations.
